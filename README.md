# Hex-Game-Playing-Agent

## Overview
Implement a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to play the board game Hex.

## Heuristics
Multiple different heuristics were implemented. A major heuristic is the "Diagonal Dominance" heuristic where the agent aims to completely dominate the middle diagonal line that connects all sides of the rhombus board. This diagonal is the single line in which both teams could win with, and hence it was thought the domination of this mid line is a critical winning strategy.

## Learning rate
A dynamic learning rate was implemented.
